		<H2>This is a Heading too! (h2)</H2>

		There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For
		instance you can make words 
		<b>bold</b>, 
		<strong>important</strong>, 
		<i>italicc</i>, 
		<em>emphasized</em>, 
		<small>small...</small>
		<br>
		<mark>the</mark> 
		<del>list</del> 
		<ins>goes</ins>
		<sub>on</sub>
		<sup>and</sup>
		on.
		</p>

		<p>
		You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:
		<blockquote>
    	Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other
    	time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the <br>change that
    	we seek.
    	</blockquote></p>

		<h1>Blocks and Inline Elements</h1>
		<div>A &lt;div&gt; is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line
		and take up the full width available.</div>
		<br><div>And a &lt;span&gt; tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.</div>
